This file specifies the path to your aspose slides for Java path. Put the following lines in that file:\r\n```yaml\r\ndevelopment:\r\n  jar_dir: /path/to/your/asposeslides/jars/directory\r\ntest:\r\n  jar_dir: /path/to/your/asposeslides/jars/directory\r\n```\r\n* Next you need to initialize the aspose library. Aspose is a paid library and therefor you need to buy the appropriate license and provide the path to the licensed java library to initialize the gem.\r\n* Create a file called aspose.rb under the initializer app/config/initializers folder. Put the following lines in the file\r\n```ruby\r\nAsposeslides.configure_aspose_slides YAML.load(File.read('config/aspose.yml'))[Rails.env]\r\n```\r\n* Now is the time to include the required files for working with the powerpoint presentations. Following is an example of merging 2 presentations into one:\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'asposeslides'\r\ninclude Asposeslides\r\ninclude Asposeslides::Powerpoint\r\ninitialize_aspose\r\ndest_ppt = File.join('dest_template.pptx')\r\nsrc_ppt1 = File.join('src_template1.pptx')\r\nsrc_ppt2 = File.join('src_template2.pptx')\r\nmerged_ppt = merge_ppts(dest_ppt, [{:ppt => src_ppt1, :position => 2, :replace => true}, {:ppt => src_ppt2, :position => 5, :replace => true}])\r\nmerged_ppt.save(\"merged.pptx\",3)\r\n```\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it ( https://github.com/sanjusoftware/asposeslides/fork )\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create a new Pull Request\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
